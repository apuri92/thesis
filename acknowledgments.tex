I would like to thank my advisors Professor Matthias Grosse Perdekamp and Anne Marie Sickles for their invaluable support and guidance throughout my time at the University of Illinois. Their experience as researchers was extremely valuable for myself and the rest of the group with whom I worked. I started working with Matthias as soon as I arrived in Illinois in 2013. I always appreciated his support, enthusiasm, and knowledge of physics. Besides his tremendous knowledge of nuclear and particle physics, Matthias is someone with whom one can discuss virtually anything; from politics to soccer. Anne was the driving force behind the ATLAS Heavy Ion group at Illinois. Thanks to her, it has grown into a strong group that contributes to the field in many different ways. It was a great experience to work for Matthias and Anne, and I thank them for providing me with the opportunity.

Martin Rybar, who was the postdoctoral researcher in our group for the majority of  the time I spent working on the ATLAS experiment has been a great advisor and friend. He was always keen to share his knowledge of physics and analysis with me, was there to help whenever I needed it, and taught me a lot of what I know about ATLAS. I definitely progressed much faster in my research thanks to him, and I am very happy for anyone who will get the great opportunity to work with him in the future. 

Next, I would like to thank all the members of the ATLAS collaboration for their expertise and for being great colleagues. It was a unique experience being part of such a team, and I am glad to say I got to do so. ATLAS is a large collaboration, and while I would like to thank everyone individually, I specifically want to mention my colleagues from the Heavy Ion group, with whom I worked closely. Thank you Peter Steinburg, Martin Spousta, Aaron Angerami, Brian Cole, Dennis Perepelitsa, Sebastian Tapia for providing insightful physics advice, reading my paper drafts, and for making the Heavy Ion group what it is. 

Lastly, want to thank my parents for all their support from the first day I can remember it. I cannot thank them enough for everything they have done. I am very happy they were able to attend my thesis defense, it meant a great deal to me, and I know it meant even more to them. My father, himself a physicist, always was eager to talk to me about my work. We had many interesting conversations in person and over the phone, and he always gave me interesting advice and ideas. My mother was always curious about what I was doing, about CERN, and in general about life as a graduate student. Thank you Daniel, Anton, and Michael for being great brothers and friends. I will be waiting for the days when you will be defending, and I hope things keep going smoothly for you. While she could not be with us now, my late grandmother Anna was always there in my thoughts, and I want to say thank you for everything babushka. Even though we live far away from one another, I always knew I had my family close by, and I cannot thank them enough for this.

Thank you family, friends, and colleagues with whom I had the pleasure to talk to, work and spend time with, and in general learn from over these years.
