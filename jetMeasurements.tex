This chapter shall discuss some important experimental jet measurements that contextualize and motivate the study of the main analysis in this thesis.
These include the study of the jet yields, dijet asymmetry, and jet fragmentation.
Before delving into the measurements however, there is a discussion of some common kinematic quantities, as well as a discussion of some jet reconstruction algorithms.
