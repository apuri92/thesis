\section{Reviewing and updating the Run 1 Analysis}

We will start with the starting point from the Run 1 note. Namely, we define the per-jet measure- ment errors in terms of terms that are fully correlated between EMTopo and HI collections and terms that are completely uncorrelated. For now, we assume the correlated contribution is the same for both collections.

\begin{align}
\Delta \pt^\em = \Delta_c + \Delta_\em
\end{align}
