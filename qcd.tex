The Standard Model (SM) \cite{Gaillard:1998ui} describes the interactions between elementary particles that are listed in Figure~\ref{fig:sm_particles}. It is one the most successful theories in physics and describes three of the four fundamental forces of nature. These are the strong interaction, the weak interaction, and the electromagnetic interaction. A quantum theory for gravity is not part of the SM.

Within the SM, the dynamics of the strong interactions involving quarks and gluons are described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a gauge theory with SU(3) symmetry. Quarks are fermions with a spin of $1/2$, and carry a fractional electric charge as well as a color charge. They all have mass and come in six flavors: up, down, top, bottom, strange, charm. The lightest quarks (u and d) combine and form stable particles, while the heavier quarks can only be produced in energetic environments and decay rapidly. Gluons are gauge bosons (force carriers) with a spin of $1$, and are what hold quarks together.

The dynamics of the quarks and gluons are described by the QCD Lagrangian given as \cite{Beringer:1481544}:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{{L}}_{\mathrm{QCD}} = \sum_q \bar{\psi}_{q,a} (i \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \delta_{ab} - g_s \gamma^\mu t_{ab}^C \mathcal{A}_\mu^C - m_q \delta_{ab}) \psi_{q,b} - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}^A F^{A \mu\nu}
\end{align}


where $\psi_{q,a}$ and $\psi_{q,b}$ are quark-filed spinors for a quarks with flavor $q$, mass $m_q$, and color $a$ and $b$ respectively, with the values for $a$ and $b$ ranging  from 1 to 3 (for the three colors). The $\mathcal{A_\mu^C}$ corresponds to the gluon field with $C$ taking values from 1 through 8 (for the 8 types of gluons). The $t_{ab}^C$ corresponds to the Gell-Mann matrices that are the generators of the SU(3) group, and dictate the rotation of the quarks color in SU(3) space when it interacts with a gluon. The coupling constant is encoded within $g_s$, which is defined by $g_s \equiv \sqrt{4 \pi \alpha_s}$. The field tensor $F_{\mu\nu}^A$ can be written in terms of the structure constants of the SU(3) group $f_{ABC}$, and is given by:

\begin{align}
F_{\mu\nu}^A = \partial_\mu \mathcal{A}_\nu^A - \partial_\nu \mathcal{A}_\mu^A - g_s f_{ABC} \mathcal{A}^B \mathcal{A}^C
\end{align}


While many parallels can be drawn between Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and QCD, the latter is a richer theory because its non-Abelian structure allows gluon-gluon interactions in addition to quark-gluon interactions. These interactions can be summarized as shown in Figure \ref{fig:qcd_diagrams}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{The allowed vertices in QCD. The vertices involving two or more gluons are unique to QCD and do not have a QED analog. }
\label{fig:qcd_diagrams}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

A core feature of QCD is that the coupling constant \alphas\ has an energy dependence shown in Figure~\ref{fig:running_coupling}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/theory/running_coupling}
\caption{The running coupling constant $\alpha_s$ as a function of the momentum transfer $Q$. Figure taken from Ref. \cite{Beringer:1481544}. }
\label{fig:running_coupling}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

This dependence can be expressed in terms of the $\beta$ function as

\begin{align}
Q^2 \frac{\partial \alpha_s (Q^2)}{\partial Q^2} = \beta(\alpha_s (Q^2))
\end{align}

where $Q$ is the momentum transfer in the particle reaction. The beta function can be expressed using perturbative QCD (pQCD) as

\begin{align}
\beta( \alpha_s ) = - (b_0 \alpha_s^2 + b_1 \alpha_s^3 + b_2 \alpha_s^4... )
\end{align}

where the coefficients $b_i$ depend on the number of colors and flavors.

This running coupling constant is small and asymptotically tends to zero at large energy scales (or at small distances) and is large at small energy scales (large distances). This running coupling phenomenon leads to two key behaviors: asymptotic freedom and color confinement. 


\subparagraph{Asymptotic Freedom: }
At high energy scales (small distances), the QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$ is small and tends to zero, implying a free particle behavior of quarks and gluons. This has been observed by a variety of deep inelastic experiments \cite{Deur:2014vea, Kim:1998kia, Altarelli:1996nm, RevModPhys.63.597, Kataev:2001kk, Alekhin:2012ig, Alekhin:2013nua, Blumlein:2006be, Aaron:2007xx, Chekanov:2007pa, Chekanov:2008af, Abramowicz:2010cka, Abramowicz:2010ke, Aaron:2009vs}


\subparagraph{Color Confinement}
The opposite end of the running coupling constant phenomenon is color confinement. This property of QCD forbids the direct observation of free quarks and gluons, allowing only for composite particles that are color singlets.
