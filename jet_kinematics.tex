This section defines some common quantities that are used throughout this thesis.

\subparagraph{Center of mass energy:}

\subparagraph{Energy and momentum:}
This analysis primarily deals with transverse momenta.
This is the projection of the momenta on the plane transverse to the beam axis. 
It is given by:

\begin{align}
\pt = |p| \sin\theta
\end{align}
\subparagraph{Rapidity and Pseudorapidity:}
