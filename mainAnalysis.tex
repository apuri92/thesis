\section{Overview}

Measurements of jets in heavy ion collisions are powerful tools to determine the properties of the quark gluon plasma by measuring the modification of jet production and fragmentation after the jets have traversed the hot QCD matter.
As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:jetMeasurements}, jets with large transverse momenta in central lead-lead (\pbpb) collisions at the LHC are measured at approximately half the rates in \pp\ collisions when the nuclear overlap function of \pbpb\ collisions is taken into account~\cite{Abelev:2013kqa,Aad:2014bxa,Adam:2015ewa,Khachatryan:2016jfl, Khachatryan:2016odn, 2019108}.
Back-to-back dijet~\cite{Aad:2010bu,Chatrchyan:2011sx,Aaboud:2017eww} and photon-jet pairs~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012gt,2019167} are observed to have less balanced transverse momenta in \pbpb\ collisions compared to \pp\ collisions.
Jet shape measurements in the \pp\ and \pbpb\ collision systems have shown a broadening of the jets due to the QGP~\cite{Aad:2011sc, Acharya:2018uvf, Chatrchyan:2012mec, Chatrchyan:2013kwa}, and jet fragmentation functions in \pbpb\ collisions are modified with an excess for low and high momentum particles and depletion of intermediate momentum particles inside the jet compared to pp collisions~\cite{Aad:2014wha,Chatrchyan:2014ava,Aaboud:2017bzv,PhysRevC.98.024908}.
Particles carrying a large fraction of the jet momentum are generally closely aligned with the jet axis, whereas low momentum particles are observed to have a much broader angular distribution extending outside the jet~\cite{Chatrchyan:2011sx,Khachatryan2016,Khachatryan:2016tfj,Sirunyan:2018jqr}.
All these studies have suggested that the energy lost via jet-quenching is being transferred to soft particles around the jet axis via soft gluon emission~\cite{Vitev:2008rz,Ovanesyan:2011xy,Blaizot:2014ula,Qin:2015srf,Escobedo:2016jbm,Casalderrey-Solana:2016jvj,Tachibana:2017syd} and investigating the radial distribution of particles as a function of transverse momentum has the potential to provide further insight into the structure of jets in the QGP.
This can help provide information on not only how the jet is affected by the plasma, but also how the plasma is affected by the jet.

This thesis presents charged-particle \pt\ distributions around the jet axis as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cartoon_dptr}. 
The measured yields are defined as:

\end{figure}


\begin{align}
\Dptr = \frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{jet}}} \frac{1}{A} \frac{\mathrm{d} n_{\mathrm{ch}} (\pt, r)}{\mathrm{d} \pt},
\end{align}
where $r = \sqrt{\Delta \eta^2 + \Delta \phi^2}$ is the angular distance from the jet axis and $N_{\mathrm{jet}}$ is the number of jets in consideration.
$A = \pi (r_{\mathrm{max}}^2 - r_{\mathrm{min}}^2) $ is the area of an annulus around the jet axis with its inner and outer radii $r_{\mathrm{min}}$ and $r_{\mathrm{max}}$ respectively and $n_{\mathrm{ch}}(\pt, r)$ is the number of charged particles with a given \pt\ within the annulus.
The boundaries of the annuli are given by: 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8.
The ratios of the charged-particle yields measured in \pbpb\ and \pp\ collisions,

\begin{align}
   \RDptr = \frac{\Dptr_\mathrm{Pb+Pb}}{\Dptr_{\pp}},
\end{align}
quantify the modifications of the yields due to the QGP medium.
Furthermore, the differences between the \Dptr\ distributions in \pbpb\ and \pp\ collisions, 

\begin{align}
   \Delta \Dptr = \Dptr_\mathrm{Pb+Pb} - \Dptr_{pp},
\end{align}
allow for measuring the absolute differences in charged-particle yields between the two collision systems.
