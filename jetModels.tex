This chapter shall discuss a few models that have been used to explain the data, looking in particular at the following: Effective Quenching (EQ), Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), Hybrid Model, and Jet Fluid Model. These models form the backdrop in which the main thesis analysis was conducted.
